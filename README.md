The Wine Pairing Project will accept most any food, ingredient, or cuisine-type input for which you want a wine to compliment. It will return:
  * Multiple types of wine pairings
  * Explanations on why these wine pairings fit your food, ingredient, or cuisine
  * A recommended product, its price, and its label (if label is available)
  * A description of the recommended product
  * A link that will brings you to a page where you can buy this recommended product in a new window
  
The Wine Pairing Project takes advantage of the following technologies:
  * jquery
  * ajax requests to the Spoonacular API
  * media queries to format it for mobile and desktop use
  
The next step for this project is to format and style for medium-sized screens such as tablets. Then, if not too cumbersome, provide suggestions of recipes to go with the food, ingredient, or cuisine of choice.
